So.. It's done! For now, anyway.

I was hoping to get further with this, but I hope
you will enjoy what is there. The game *should*
be fairly self-explanatory, but if you need help
feel free to tweet me @TheEnemby .

If you enjoyed this game, and want to play more of mine,
check out my itch.io page at

Thanks!
