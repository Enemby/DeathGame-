So.. It's done! For now, anyway.
In case it's not obvious, Death Game+ was made in
about a month to test a theory I had on games
distribution. I was able to prove I could potentially
survive off of game dev if I made a game a month,
but the margins are very tight. I hope you enjoy
what I could get done in that timeframe.

I was hoping to get further with this, but I hope
you will enjoy what is there. The game *should*
be fairly self-explanatory, but if you need help
feel free to tweet me @TheEnemby .

If you enjoyed this game, and want to play more of mine,
check out my itch.io page at

Thanks!
